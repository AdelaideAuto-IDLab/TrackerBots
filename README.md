## Introduction

TrackerBots is an open source framework to develop a fully autonomous system for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to track multiple radio-tagged objects. For more information about the TrackerBots, please read our paper:  Van Nguyen, H., Chesser, M., Rezatofighi, S. H., & Ranasinghe, D. C. (2017). Real-Time Localization and Tracking of Multiple Radio-Tagged Animals with an Autonomous Aerial Vehicle System. ArXiv Preprint [ArXiv:1712.01491](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01491). 
Demo video can be found at [TrackBots - JoFR 2018](https://youtu.be/mHMOWIHFmcY).
