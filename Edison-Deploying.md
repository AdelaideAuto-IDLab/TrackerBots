## Instructions to install the pulse_server on an Intel Edison board

## 1. Installing the rust version

* Download the rust tar file from: `https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/other-installers.html` (Standalone installers)
* Extract the `tar.gz` locally
* Delete unneeded rust components
* Run `rustup toolchain link custom /home/root/rust-nightly-i686-unknown-linux-gnu/rustc`

## 2. Installing `pulse_server`

* Configure networking:
    * Connect phone to `football` network.
    * Connect phone to computer via USB 
    * Set phone into USB tethering mode
    * Manually configure the routing table (in the case of overlapping routing) e.g. for Edison IP address = `192.168.2.15` and gateway address = `192.168.42.129`
	```
	route add 192.168.2.15 MASK 255.255.255.255 192.168.42.129
	```
    * Forward a http proxy from the host machine to the edison `ssh -R 3128:localhost:3128 root@192.168.2.15` (for a squid proxy running on port 3128)
    * Ensure that the http proxy is set: `git config --global http.proxy http://localhost:3128` and in `~/.cargo/config`
* Check that the Edison time is up to date (can cause certificate errors)
* Clone the TrackerBots repo: `git clone git@github.com:AdelaideAuto-IDLab/TrackerBots.git`
* Navigate to `~/TrackerBots/code/telemetry/pulse_server`
* Run the command:
```
RUSTFLAGS="--sysroot /home/root/rust-nightly-i686-unknown-linux-gnu/rust-std-i686-unknown-linux-gnu/" ~/cargo run --release
```

## 3. Set Auto start config

* Run the `copy.sh` and `enable.sh` scripts in `services` folder

* Check if `pulse_server` is running or not:

  ```
  journalctl -r -u pulse_server # check if pulse server is working
  ```

* If not, you can restart it by:

  ```
  systemctl restart pulse_server # restart pulse server
  ```

## 4. Enable Access Point (AP) mode for the board

https://software.intel.com/en-us/getting-started-with-ap-mode-for-intel-edison-board
The following instructions work best on an Intel速 Edison board assembled with the Arduino expansion board. 
To enter AP Mode with the Intel速 Edison mini breakout board, 
you must establish a serial communication session with your board and use the command line:

```
configure_edison --enableOneTimeSetup.
```

Entering AP mode and connecting to a Wi-Fi network

```
* On your board, hold down the button labeled PWR for more than 2 seconds but no longer than 7 seconds. Around 4 seconds is sufficient.

* The LED at JS2 near the center of the board should now be blinking. It will remain blinking as long as your board is in AP mode.
* In a few moments, a Wi-Fi network hotspot appears. Typically, its name is in the form of: Edison-xx-xx, where xx-xx is the last two places of your board's Wi-Fi mac address. This mac address is on a label within the plastic chip holder that contained the Intel速 Edison chipset within the packaging. However, if you have given your board a name, the Wi-Fi hotspot has the same name.
* When you find your board's Wi-Fi hotspot, attempt to connect.  The passcode necessary to connect is the chipset serial number, which is also on the label in the plastic chip holder beneath the mac address.  Additionally, a small white label on the Intel速 Edison chipset itself also states the serial number. The passcode is case-sensitive.
* Once you have connected to the hotspot, open a browser (preferably Firefox or Chrome) and enter Edison.local in the URL bar. The following screen displays: 
```

You want manuelly to switch back from AP mode in Client mode of Wifi? simply run 
configure_edison --setup again

```
systemctl stop hostapd
systemctl disable hostapd
systemctl enable wpa_supplicant
systemctl start wpa_supplicant
wpa_cli reconfigure
wpa_cli select_network wlan0
udhcpc -i wlan0
```

Install nmap to check port open or not

```
sudo apt-get install nmap
nmap -p 22 192.168.42.1
```

Then you need to connect your laptop to Edison AP.
